# Motivation 
## Recruiting Students of Color

Recruiting by colleges and universities affect access for Students of Color (SOC)
  - Off-campus recruiting visits influence where SOC apply and enroll
  - Especially first-generation and low-income students


<br> 

Recent research on recruiting visits highlights
  - Public research universities focus their recruiting visits in out-of-state, affluent, predominantly White public high schools (Salazar, Jaquette, & Han, Online First)
  - Public research universities engage in "recruitment redlining" -- circuitous avoidance of public high schools in predominantly Black and Latinx communities along visit paths (Salazar, forthcoming)

<br> 

Where does racial diversity of prospective student pool come from?
  - Private colleges disproportionately enroll Students of Color from elite private schools
  - Do recruiting patterns by public research universities show similar patterns of preferences for prospective Students of Color?
    - Quantitative case-study of recruiting across public and private high schools; by one public research university; within one metropolitan area

# Literature Review
## Intra-Racial Screening Practices 

Organizational and legal scholarship suggests discrimination also occurs intra-racially
  - Colorism; racial palatability (Carbado & Gulati, 2013)


<br>  

Intra-racial screening practices within admissions practices [ethnographies]
  - Black students with high racial salience less likely to receive responses from admissions counselors than those with low racial salience  (Thornhill, 2019)
  - Elite colleges "hedge their bets" in meeting diversity goals by recruiting SOC from elite private schools (Jack, 2019)
  - To increase diversity of applicant pools, recruiters visit "special" public high schools with really "interesting" students (Stevens, 2007)
  

<br>

Do recruiting visits intra-racially screen SOC based on schools targeted? [systematic analyses]
  - Focus on out-of-state, affluent, predominantly White public high schools (Salazar, Jaquette, & Han, Online First) 
  - "Redline" public public high schools in predominantly Black and Latinx communities (Salazar, forthcoming)
  - Gap: probability of receiving a visit across public and private schools through the lens of recruiting SOC

# Conceptual Framework
## Racial Capitalism 


Racial Capitalism 
- Systems of Racism and Capitalism explain the process by which predominantly White organizations derive social value from non-White identities
- Use of race for determining value is longstanding characteristic of systemic racism (Harris, 1993)
  - White/Whiteness = social and economic value accrue to those that possess it 
  - Non-White/non-Whiteness = historically used for withholding value
- Ex: Higher Ed grounded in history of denying access based on non-Whiteness (e.g., HBCUs, non-resident enrollment/tuition policies, holistic admissions)

<br>

Non-Whiteness has recently been conferred value based on preoccupation with diversity
  - Ex: Affirmative Action legislation
    - Originally proposed as a form of reparations 
    - Now only justifies increase in diversity efforts because of it's "benefit for all"

<br>

Commodification of non-White identities 
  - Diversity as a social good exploits People of Color to capitalize on their representational diversity
  - Exemplified in growing pressure for colleges to market/recruit/enroll diverse classes
  - EX: Crafting admissions materials that portray greater diversity than student body (e.g., photoshopping SOC into photos)

# Conceptual Framework
## Recruiting "Proximity to Whiteness"

Not all commodities have equal exchange value `r citep(bib[c('RN5055')])`
- Racial diversity has acquired some value, but limited to "narrow set of scripts" approved by White norms
- Organizations extract the most value from non-White identities that can: `r citep(bib[c('RN0003')])`
  - Increase representational diversity for the organization
  - Minimize the organizations' need to manage racial salience
  - Easily assimilate into colorblind, predominantly White cultures 

<br>

Recruiting "proximity to whiteness"  via which schools SOC attend
- Literature suggests private colleges want SOC that are already socialized to Whiteness vis-a-vis their high schools
  - Private schools > public high schools `r citep(bib[c('RN5058')])`
  - Public high schools with predominantly White students > Public high schools with predominantly SOC `r citep(bib[c('RN3519')])`
- Do these patterns apply to recruiting by a public research university?

# Methods
## Case selection and data analysis

Case selection based on purposeful sampling to identify "information rich" cases `r citep(bib[c('RN4549')])`
- Metro areas with sufficient racial and socioeconomic diversity
- Avoid major "school choice" cities (e.g., Denver, New Orleans, New York City)
- Universities with greatest number of recruiting visits to metros selected

<br>

Cases
- Los Angeles MSA
  - University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) 

<br>

Data analysis
- Descriptive statistics and geospatial visualizations

# Summary of findings
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Schools within white communities are more likely to receive a recruiting visit than schools within Communities of Color
- Across high, mid, low income levels 
- Exception: mid income communities in LA (although not proportional)

<br>

Racial biases intensify with multiple visits
- Schools within white communities are more likely to receive multiple visits and visits from multiple universities

<br>

Recruiting reinforces the geography of *unequal* college opportunity
- Visits are clustered in predominantly high and mid income White suburbs (i.e., "College Oases")
- Spatial redlining of Latinx and Black communities within MSA centers across income levels (i.e., "College Deserts")

# Implications
## Policy, practice, and advocacy

Policy: Greater consideration of (critical) "supply side" scholarship in policy discourse
- Scholarship aimed at changing the behavior of students has dominated policy discourse
- Largely ignores the enrollment management behavior of universities


<br>

Practice: recruiting can circumvent geography of unequal college opportunity but...
- "Going where we have always gone" is continuing a historical legacy of racism in the governing of admissions spaces
- Administrators and practitioners need to enact anti-racist practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with low-income students and Students of Color

<br>

Advocacy
- Under-visited high schools can reshape and demand new recruiting practices by universities
  - Leverage the strengths of communities (talent, funds of knowledge, culture, family, local, loyalty, service)
- University professionals and faculty can hold universities accountable
