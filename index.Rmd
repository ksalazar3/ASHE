# Motivation
## Policy discourse about access to public research universities

The problem: access to public research universities
- Historical mission of social mobility for state residents
- Concern about growing socioeconomic and racial inequality in access


<br>
Mainstream policy discourse about access inequality 
- "Achievement gap", "under-matching"; place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
- Universities pledge commitment to access via policies and statements (e.g., no-loan financial aid policies)
- Problem with policy discourse: decades of research finds policy adoption a symbolic effort to appease stakeholders `r cite(bib['RN2436'])`



---

# Motivation
## Analyze recruiting to understand university enrollment priorities

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or Communities of Color

<br>
Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities spend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities


<br>
Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a high school) as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- Two empirical studies:
    - **(1) ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities**
        - Similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities
    - **(2) Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment**
       -  Spatial, in-depth exploration of racial bias in out-of-state recruiting visits


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*  `r citep(bib['RN4017'])`
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")
- Applauds public universities for adopting progressive policies to increase access despite the “deficiencies” of student and K-12 schools and despite declines in state funding. 
```

# Data Collection
## The broader off-campus recruiting research project

*** =left

**Data collection**

* Method
    - Web-scrape admissions websites
    - Public records requests
* Criteria to be included in data collection
    1. Post visits on admissions websites
    2. Organizational type
* Data collection sample (larger project)
    - 54 public research; 49 private; 42 liberal arts
* Data collection period
    - 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017
    - Ongoing data collection with larger sample
* Secondary Data
    - ACS; NCES; EdFacts; State DOE

# Empirical study #1 
## ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities

Research problem
- Research on recruiting practices can transform access inequality policy discourse
- But few empirical studies analyze recruiting behavior

<br>

Research aim
- Systematically analyze off-campus recruiting visits by public research universities

<br>

Research question
- What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?

<br>


Analytic focus
- Income, race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state


---

# Literature review
## Scholarship on recruiting

Scholarship analyzing college perspective `r citep(bib['RN3519'])`
  - Important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
  - Focus on visiting affluent schools and private schools
    
<br>
  
Scholarship analyzing perspective of high school students `r citep(bib['RN4324'])`
  - Which universities visit affects student decisions
  - First-gen, students of color swayed to apply and enroll to colleges that make them feel wanted
  - High income students concerned with prestige

<br>
Research gap: we don't know which universities visit which schools, communities


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Theoretical framework -->
<!-- ## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior -->

<!-- Theoretical motivation for studying recruiting -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- - "New" institutional theory `r citep(bib['RN513'])` -->
<!--     - Organizations have finite resources and cannot pursue multiple goals `r citep(bib['RN531'])` -->
<!--     -When facing pressure to pursue many goals, organizations:  -->
<!--       - Substantively adopt some goals (directing resources) -->
<!--       - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric) -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- - "Iron triangle" of enrollment management (EM) -->
<!--   - Three broad enrollment goals: **access, academic profile, revenue** -->
<!--   - Scarce resources; depending on priorities, some goals receive more resources than others -->
<!--   - Off-campus recruiting is allocation of resources -->
<!--   - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting interventions indicate enrollment priorities -->



---

# Theoretical framework
## Expectations about similarities and differences in recruiting behavior

Resource dependence theory (RDT) `r citep(bib['RN959'])`
- Organizations are sensitive to demands from providers of critical resources
- *Universities with weak state funding*
    - More visits to affluent out-of-state, affluent in-state
- *Universities with small/declining "college age" population*
    - More out-of-state visits

<br>
Academic Capitalism (AC) `r citep(bib['RN6061'])` 
- RDT assumes restoring state funding would compel universities to de-emphasize nonresident enrollment/recruiting
- AC suggests pursuit of revenue displaces public-good mission for market logic
- *Recruiting by universities with similar external conditions can differ depending to what extent "market logic" ideology is adopted*

<!-- # Research methods -->
<!-- ## Defining events -->

<!-- **"Off-campus recruiting events" defined as off-campus events hosted by paid staff/consultants focused on soliciting applications** -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- - Event type -->
<!--     - Include: college fairs, high school visits, community college visits, -->
<!-- counselor events -->
<!--     - Exclude: admitted or committed student events, interviews -->
<!-- - Event host -->
<!--     - Include: paid admissions staff or consultants (e.g. regional recruiters) -->
<!--     - Exclude: alumni, student volunteers -->
<!-- - Event location -->
<!--     - Any off-campus location -->
<!--     - e.g., high school, community college, hotel, convention center, cafe, etc. -->

# Research methods
## Research design and analyses

Quantitative multiple case study research design `r citep(bib['RN4545'])`
- Quantitative data collection and quantitative analyses
- Analyze each case separately, rather than pooling across cases as in large-N, random sample design

<br>
Data analysis `r citep(bib[c('RN4116','RN4391')])`
- "Within-case" analyses of recruiting patterns
    - Simple descriptive statistics (e.g., counts), static visualizations, interactive maps
    - Linear probability models controlling for other factors impacting probability of receiving visit 
- "Cross-case" analyses
    - Consolidate first-order findings from "within-case" into broader empirical themes

# Summary of results
## ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities

Out of State Recruiting
- Majority of visits are out-of-state (exceptions: UC Irvine, UC Berkeley); in populous metros
- Income bias; visits concentrated in highly affluent communities, in metropolitan areas
- Racial bias; less likely to visit schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native students
- Disproportionate number of visits to private high schools

<br>

In-State Recruiting
- Variation in coverage of public high schools (e.g., Nebraska=88%; Alabama=33%)
- Income bias (most cases, but less than out-of-state) even after controlling for other factors
- Bias against schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native in some cases (e.g., Alabama)
- Rural bias; in some cases even after controlling for other factors (e.g., UC Irvine)

<br> 

Recruiting for Resources (RDT) or Recruiting Market Values (AC)
- RDT: Universities with the worst state funding have the most out-of-state visits (Berkeley vs. Irvine)
- AC: Cases with relatively more better environmental conditions do not have a lesser focus on out-of-state (e.g., UMass Amherst, Nebraska)
  
  

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Discussion -->
<!-- ## Implications, future research -->

<!-- Implications -->
<!-- - Results suggest dramatic income bias in enrollment priorities of public research universities -->
<!--     - Evidence of racial bias (especially in out-of-state recruiting), but patterns more nuanced -->
<!-- - Policy discourse should focus on enrollment priorities, rather than student, K-12 deficiencies -->
<!--     - "Under-recruiting" as an alternative explanation for "under-matching" -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Policy + Advocacy Reccomendations: how do we change university enrollment priorities? -->
<!-- - Increasing state appropriations and state need-based grant aid -->
<!-- - Nonresident enrollment caps -->
<!-- - Empower local access advocates  -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Future research -->
<!-- - Manuscript that focuses on spatial discrimination of communities of color -->
<!-- - Collect/analyze data on other means used to identify and target prospects -->
<!--     - Characteristics universities prioritize when purchasing "prospect lists" from College Board/ACT? -->
<!--     - Experimental audits of university responses to "inquiries" with different characteristics -->

# Empirical study #2
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Racial inequality is grounded in the governing of space and its impact on where People of Color live `r citep(bib[c('RN2038', 'RN2547', 'RN5070' )])`
  - Forced migration of indigenous people and seizure of their ancestral lands
  - Plessy v. Ferguson 
  - Policies and court decisions abetted "de facto" segregation after Brown v. Board of Education 
  - Federal and state regulatory tolerance of "reverse redlining" (i.e., predatory lending) 

<br> 

Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6067')])`
  - Communities of Color, particularly low-income communities, are likely to live in areas with limited access to critical resources needed for collective wealth and power 
    - e.g., fair housing, jobs, health facilities

<br> 

Geography of *College* Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])`
- *Geography* reinforces access inequality
- Communities of Color have the fewest four-year colleges nearby; many options are for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])`

---
# Motivation
## Do recruiting visits reinforce the geography of unequal college opportunity?
But how does the *behavior* of universities *reinforce* the geography of *unequal* college opportunity?
  - Racial access inequality is grounded in the governing of (admissions) space(s) 
    - e.g, HBCUs, out-of-state tuition and non-resident enrollment caps, SAT/ACT `r cite(bib[c('RN6012', 'RN6011')])`


<br>  

Students' college opportunities are also shaped by the (enrollment management) choices of universities `r citep(bib[c('RN6068')])`
  - Universities are not immobile in their efforts to provide access 
  - Chapter 3 finds schools with greater proportions of Students of Color are less likely to get a visit
    - Schools are not randomly geographically scattered; clustered within segregated Communities of Color
  - Spatial discrimination linked to perpetual racial disparities in the geography of opportunity

<br>

RQ: Do recruiting efforts by public universities spatially discriminate against Communities of Color?
  - Spatial distribution of out-of-state recruiting visits within the Los Angeles and Dallas MSAs
  - Spatial relationships between race, income, and academic achievement


<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Literature review -->
<!-- ## Geography of College Opportunity -->

<!-- Number of nearby colleges and universities impacts college-going behavior `r citep(bib[c('RN6065')])` -->
<!--   - Each additional college in proximity to home increases odds of applying to (any) college -->
<!--   - But proximity to local colleges varied widely -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- "College Deserts" and "College Oases" `r citep(bib[c('RN5095')])` -->
<!--   - Communities of color and communities with low educational attainment  -->
<!--     - More likely to live in areas with fewer 4-year colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])` -->
<!--     - More likely to live in urban areas with more 2-year public and for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])` -->
<!--   - White communities and communities with higher educational attainment -->
<!--     - More likely to live in suburban areas with more 4-year colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN5095')])` -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Recruiting can circumvent the geography of *unequal* college opportunity; but all literature focuses on analyzing location -->
<!--   - Universities are not passive actors fixed to their physical campuses -->
<!--   - Considerable resources are spent on identifying and recruiting prospective students -->
<!--   - Do recruiting practices circumvent or reinforce the geography of *unequal* college opportunity? -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Enrollment Management -->
<!-- ## Neutralized and deracialized practices  -->
<!-- Iron triangle of EM -->
<!-- - EM as neutral, rational, and efficiency maximizing  -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- Academic Capitalism -->
<!-- - Universities are not neutral in targeting students for the extraction of revenue -->
<!-- - Race effects within EM practices are due to differential distribution of wealth among racial groups -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- Universities and EM practices are not race-neutral `r citep(bib[c('RN2525')])` -->
<!-- - Schemas: unconscious, cognitive assumptions as templates for organizational practices -->
<!--   - e.g., gender inequality is reproduced via gendered schemas of the "ideal worker" `r citep(bib[c('RN2539')])` -->
<!-- - Racial access inequality is reproduced via racialized schemas of the "ideal college student"  -->
<!--   - e.g., high SAT/ACT scores, no need for financial aid, enrolls full-time, few obligations besides college classes, lives on campus, ready to begin college-level courses `r citep(bib[c('RN5089')])`  -->

# Conceptual Framework
## Place-based whiteness as property

Whiteness as property `r citep(bib[c('RN2526')])`
- Law grants holders of whiteness the same privileges granted to holders of other types of property
- Reputation and Status property: 

<br>

Place-based whiteness as property
- Connections between race and place
  - "The inner city" vs "suburbs" or "urban schools" vs "suburban schools"
- Racial inequality and white privilege are not simply reflected in space
- Racialized and discriminatory practices are enacted through the use of place

<br>

Recruiting as a raced practice enacted via place
- Are Communities of Color equally as likely to receive a recruiting visit as white communities with comparable income and achievement characteristics?

# Summary of findings
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Schools within white communities are more likely to receive a recruiting visit than schools within Communities of Color
- Across high, mid, low income levels 
- Exception: mid income communities in LA (although not proportional)

<br>

Racial biases intensify with multiple visits
- Schools within white communities are more likely to receive multiple visits and visits from multiple universities

<br>

Recruiting reinforces the geography of *unequal* college opportunity
- Visits are clustered in predominantly high and mid income White suburbs (i.e., "College Oases")
- Spatial redlining of Latinx and Black communities within MSA centers across income levels (i.e., "College Deserts")



---
# Implications
## Policy, practice, and advocacy

Policy: Greater consideration of (critical) "supply side" scholarship in policy discourse
- Scholarship aimed at changing the behavior of students has dominated policy discourse
- Example: information asymmetries
  - Scaled "under-matching" study found null effects
  - Study on financial aid "shopping sheets" found null effects


<br>

Practice: recruiting can circumvent geography of unequal college opportunity but...
- Current efforts are based on college going process of highly affluent white students 
  - e.g., large college fairs, blocked-out visits, evening events, "coffee chats"
- Administrators and practitioners need to enact practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with low-income students and Students of Color

<br>

Advocacy
- Under-visited high schools can reshape and demand new recruiting practices by universities
  - Leverage the strengths of communities (talent, funds of knowledge, culture, family, local, loyalty, service)
- University professionals and faculty can hold universities accountable
