# Motivation 
## Contemporary racial inequality & the governing of space

Racial inequality is grounded in the governing of space and its impact on where People of Color live `r citep(bib[c('RN2038', 'RN2547', 'RN5070' )])`
  - Forced migration of indigenous people and seizure of their ancestral lands
  - Plessy v. Ferguson 
  - Policies and court decisions abetted "de facto" segregation after Brown v. Board of Education 
  - Federal and state regulatory tolerance of "reverse redlining" (i.e., predatory lending) 

<br> 

Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6067')])`
  - Communities of Color, particularly low-income communities, are likely to live in areas with limited access to critical resources needed for collective wealth and power 
    - e.g., fair housing, jobs, health facilities

<br> 

Geography of *College* Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])`
- *Geography* reinforces access inequality
- Communities of Color have the fewest four-year colleges nearby; many options are for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])`

---

# Motivation
## Do recruiting visits reinforce the geography of unequal college opportunity?

Students' college opportunities are also shaped by the (enrollment management) choices of universities `r citep(bib[c('RN6068')])`
  - Racial access inequality is grounded in the governing of (admissions) space(s) 
    - e.g., HBCUs, out-of-state tuition and non-resident enrollment caps, SAT/ACT `r cite(bib[c('RN6012', 'RN6011', 'RN3544')])`


<br>  

How does the *behavior* of universities *reinforce* the geography of *unequal* college opportunity?
  - Universities are not immobile in their efforts to provide access 
  - Salazar, Jaquette, and Han (under review) find that schools with greater proportions of Students of Color are less likely to get a visit
    - Schools are not randomly geographically scattered; within segregated Communities of Color
  - Spatial discrimination linked to perpetual racial disparities

<br>

RQ: Do recruiting efforts by public universities spatially discriminate against Communities of Color?
  - Spatial distribution of out-of-state recruiting visits within the Los Angeles and Dallas MSAs
  - Spatial relationships between race, income, and academic achievement

# Conceptual Framework
## Place-based whiteness as property


Whiteness as property (Harris, 1993)
- Whiteness as a form of property that the law ascribes privileges and protections to
- Whiteness (and non-whiteness) is also central in the racialized meanings that are ascribed to spaces
  - "The inner city" vs "suburbs" or "urban schools" vs "suburban schools"

<br>

Space vs. Place `r citep(bib[c('RN5073')])`
- Racial inequality is not simply reflected in "space"
  - Space as a location where things "just happen" 
- Rather, racialized and discriminatory practices are enacted through the use of place
  - Place as the geographical context for the "mediation" of social, racial, and economic processes 

<br>

Example: residential segregation
- Space: arbitrary, racially homogeneous communities with spatial distance between them
- Place: racially homogeneous communities as the result of systematic governing and strategic political boundaries

---

# Conceptual Framework
## Enrollment Management & Recruiting

Enrollment Management ideologies of space as "geodemographic markets" (College Board)
- Geomarkets: "people with similar cultural backgrounds, means, and perspectives naturally gravitate toward one another or form relatively homogeneous communities" 
  - "Educational neighborhoods" mapped by combining geodemographic and proprietary data
  - Represent profiles of students with "similar educational, demographic, and socioeconomic attributes"
- Iron Triangle of Enrollment Management
  - Enrollment goals: revenue, academic profile, access
  - Recruiting within some "geodemographic markets" versus not others due primarily due to the differential distribution of wealth and achievement among racial groups

<br>

Recruiting as a raced practice enacted via place
- Even if communities "reflect" similar revenue and academic profile enrollment goals:
  - White communities are more likely to receive recruiting visits because they are ascribed the privileges and economic benefits of whiteness as property

# Methods
## Case selection and data analysis

Case selection based on purposeful sampling to identify "information rich" cases `r citep(bib[c('RN4549')])`
- Metro areas with sufficient racial and socioeconomic diversity
- Avoid major "school choice" cities (e.g., Denver, New Orleans, New York City)
- Universities with greatest number of recruiting visits to metros selected

<br>

Cases
- Los Angeles MSA
  - University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) and University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass)
- Dallas MSA
  - University of Kansas (KU) and University of Georgia (UGA)

<br>

Data analysis
- Examine spatial distributions of recruiting visits across "sub-metropolitan" areas (Stoll & Ihlanfeldt, 2000)
  - Created from pooled census tracts with similar racial and income characteristics
- Descriptive statistics and geospatial visualizations

# Summary of findings
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Schools within white communities are more likely to receive a recruiting visit than schools within Communities of Color
- Across high, mid, low income levels 
- Exception: mid income communities in LA (although not proportional)

<br>

Racial biases intensify with multiple visits
- Schools within white communities are more likely to receive multiple visits and visits from multiple universities

<br>

Recruiting reinforces the geography of *unequal* college opportunity
- Visits are clustered in predominantly high and mid income White suburbs (i.e., "College Oases")
- Spatial redlining of Latinx and Black communities within MSA centers across income levels (i.e., "College Deserts")



---
# Implications
## Policy, practice, and advocacy

Policy: Greater consideration of (critical) "supply side" scholarship in policy discourse
- Scholarship aimed at changing the behavior of students has dominated policy discourse
- Largely ignores the enrollment management behavior of universities


<br>

Practice: recruiting can circumvent geography of unequal college opportunity but...
- "Going where we have always gone" is continuing a historical legacy of racism in the governing of admissions spaces
- Administrators and practitioners need to enact anti-racist practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with low-income students and Students of Color

<br>

Advocacy
- Under-visited high schools can reshape and demand new recruiting practices by universities
  - Leverage the strengths of communities (talent, funds of knowledge, culture, family, local, loyalty, service)
- University professionals and faculty can hold universities accountable
