# Motivation 
## Contemporary racial inequality & governing of space

Racial inequality is grounded in the governing of space and its impact on where People of Color live `r citep(bib[c('RN2038', 'RN2547', 'RN5070' )])`
  - Forced migration of indigenous people and seizure of their ancestral lands
  - Plessy v. Ferguson 
  - Policies and court decisions abetted "de facto" segregation after Brown v. Board of Education 
  - Federal and state regulatory tolerance of "reverse redlining" (i.e., predatory lending) 

<br> 

Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6067')])`
  - Communities of Color, particularly low-income communities, are likely to live in areas with limited access to critical resources needed for collective wealth and power 
    - e.g., fair housing, jobs, health facilities

<br> 

Geography of *College* Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])`
- *Geography* reinforces access inequality
- Communities of Color have the fewest four-year colleges nearby; many options are for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])`

---

# Motivation
## Do recruiting visits reinforce the geography of unequal college opportunity?
But how does the *behavior* of universities *reinforce* the geography of *unequal* college opportunity?
  - Racial access inequality is grounded in the governing of (admissions) space(s) 
    - e.g, HBCUs, out-of-state tuition and non-resident enrollment caps, SAT/ACT `r cite(bib[c('RN6012', 'RN6011', 'RN3544')])`


<br>  

Students' college opportunities are also shaped by the (enrollment management) choices of universities `r citep(bib[c('RN6068')])`
  - Universities are not immobile in their efforts to provide access 
  - Chapter 3 finds schools with greater proportions of Students of Color are less likely to get a visit
    - Schools are not randomly geographically scattered; clustered within segregated Communities of Color
  - Spatial discrimination linked to perpetual racial disparities in the geography of opportunity

<br>

RQ: Do recruiting efforts by public universities spatially discriminate against Communities of Color?
  - Spatial distribution of out-of-state recruiting visits within the Los Angeles and Dallas MSAs
  - Spatial relationships between race, income, and academic achievement



---

# Conceptual Framework
## Place-based whiteness as property

Whiteness as property `r citep(bib[c('RN2526')])`
- Law grants holders of whiteness the same privileges granted to holders of other types of property
- Reputation and Status property: 

<br>

Place-based whiteness as property
- Connections between race and place
  - "The inner city" vs "suburbs" or "urban schools" vs "suburban schools"
- Racial inequality and white privilege are not simply reflected in space
- Racialized and discriminatory practices are enacted through the use of place

<br>

Recruiting as a raced practice enacted via place
- Are Communities of Color equally as likely to receive a recruiting visit as white communities with comparable income and achievement characteristics?

# Methods
## Data analysis and case selection

Data analysis
- Sub-metropolitan created from pooled census tracts with similar racial and income characteristics
  - (1) High, (2) Middle, (3) Low income POC and (4)High (5) Middle (6) Low income white sub-metropolitan areas
- Descriptive statistics and geospatial visualizations 

<br>

Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and university case selection based on purposeful sampling
- Los Angeles MSA
  - University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) and University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst)
- Dallas MSA
  - University of Kansas (KU) and University of Georgia (UGA)

# Summary of findings
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Schools within white communities are more likely to receive a recruiting visit than schools within Communities of Color
- Across high, mid, low income levels 
- Exception: mid income communities in LA (although not proportional)

<br>

Racial biases intensify with multiple visits
- Schools within white communities are more likely to receive multiple visits and visits from multiple universities

<br>

Recruiting reinforces the geography of *unequal* college opportunity
- Visits are clustered in predominantly high and mid income White suburbs (i.e., "College Oases")
- Spatial redlining of Latinx and Black communities within MSA centers across income levels (i.e., "College Deserts")



---
# Implications
## Policy, practice, and advocacy

Policy: Greater consideration of (critical) "supply side" scholarship in policy discourse
- Scholarship aimed at changing the behavior of students has dominated policy discourse
- Example: information asymmetries
  - Scaled "under-matching" study found null effects
  - Study on financial aid "shopping sheets" found null effects


<br>

Practice: recruiting can circumvent geography of unequal college opportunity but...
- Current efforts are based on college going process of highly affluent white students 
  - e.g., large college fairs, blocked-out visits, evening events, "coffee chats"
- Administrators and practitioners need to enact practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with low-income students and Students of Color

<br>

Advocacy
- Under-visited high schools can reshape and demand new recruiting practices by universities
  - Leverage the strengths of communities (talent, funds of knowledge, culture, family, local, loyalty, service)
- University professionals and faculty can hold universities accountable
