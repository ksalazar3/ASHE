# Motivation
## Policy discourse about access to public research universities

The problem: access to public research universities
- Historical mission of social mobility for state residents
- Concern about growing socioeconomic and racial inequality in access

<br>
Mainstream policy discourse about access inequality 
- Supply side: "Achievement gap", "under-matching"; place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
- Demand side: Universities pledge commitment to access via policies and statements (e.g., no-loan financial aid policies)
- Problem with policy discourse: decades of research finds policy adoption a symbolic effort to appease stakeholders `r cite(bib['RN2436'])`

<br>
Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib['RN6067'])`
- Number of local colleges and universities spatially varies along the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods `r citep(bib['RN6064'])`
- Shifts onus away from students and K-12 schools; but students' college choices are also shaped by choices of colleges and universities `r citep(bib['RN6068'])`


---

# Motivation
## Analyze recruiting to understand university enrollment priorities

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or Communities of Color

<br>
Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities spend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities


<br>
Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a high school) as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- Two empirical studies:
    - **(1) ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities**
        - Similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities
    - **(2) Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment**
       -  Spatial, in-depth exploration of racial bias in out-of-state recruiting visits


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*  `r citep(bib['RN4017'])`
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")
- Applauds public universities for adopting progressive policies to increase access despite the “deficiencies” of student and K-12 schools and despite declines in state funding. 
```

# Data Collection
## The broader off-campus recruiting research project

*** =left

**Data collection**

* Method
    - Web-scrape admissions websites
    - Public records requests
* Criteria to be included in data collection
    1. Post visits on admissions websites
    2. Organizational type
* Data collection sample (larger project)
    - 54 public research; 49 private; 42 liberal arts
* Data collection period
    - 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017
    - Ongoing data collection with larger sample
* Secondary Data
    - ACS; NCES; EdFacts; State DOE

# Empirical study #1 
## ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities

Research problem
- Research on recruiting practices can transform access inequality policy discourse
- But few empirical studies analyze recruiting behavior

<br>

Research aim
- Systematically analyze off-campus recruiting visits by public research universities

<br>

Research question
- What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?

<br>


Analytic focus
- Income, race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state

#  Background
## The enrollment management industry       

*** =left

**The enrollment funnel**

<img src="assets/img/New-Admissions-Funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - Buy "student lists" from College Board/ACT
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus recruiting visits** (e.g., high
school visits, college fairs)
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * Financial aid leveraging


---

# Empirical Study #1: Literature review
## Scholarship on recruiting

Evaluations of recruiting/outreach interventions `r cite(bib[c('RN4408')])`
- But unclear whether universities substantively adopt "best practices" in less controlled settings

Audits of response to "inquiries" by admissions officers `r cite(bib['RN4361'])`
- Identifies biases of individual admissions officers

<br>
Off-campus recruiting visits
- Scholarship analyzing college perspective `r citep(bib['RN3519'])`
    - Important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
- Market research `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
    - Second highest source of "inquiries"; third highest source of enrollees 
- Scholarship analyzing perspective of high school students `r citep(bib['RN4324'])`
    - Which universities visit affects student decisions; especially first-gen, students of color

<br>
Research gap: we don't know which universities visit which schools, communities
- If schools in low-income communities or communities of color are not receiving visits, "under-matching" may be due to under-recruiting rather than lack of guidance

---

# Theoretical framework
## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior

Theoretical motivation for studying recruiting
<br>
- "New" institutional theory `r citep(bib['RN513'])`
    - Organizations have finite resources and cannot pursue multiple goals `r citep(bib['RN531'])`
    -When facing pressure to pursue many goals, organizations: 
      - Substantively adopt some goals (directing resources)
      - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric)

<br>
- "Iron triangle" of enrollment management (EM)
  - Three broad enrollment goals: **access, academic profile, revenue**
  - Scarce resources; depending on priorities, some goals receive more resources than others
  - Off-campus recruiting is allocation of resources
  - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting interventions indicate enrollment priorities



---

# Theoretical framework
## Expectations about similarities and differences in recruiting behavior

Resource dependence theory (RDT) `r citep(bib['RN959'])`
- Sensitive to demands from providers of important resources that cannot be obtained elsewhere
- Org strategies when a resource becomes uncertain/declines or demands become onerous
    - e.g., compliance, avoidance, cooptation, **resource diversification**
- *Universities with weak state funding*
    - More visits to affluent out-of-state, affluent in-state
- *Universities with small/declining "college age" population*
    - More out-of-state visits

<br>
Academic Capitalism (AC) `r citep(bib['RN6061'])` 
- RDT assumes restoring state funding would compel universities to de-emphasize nonresident enrollment/recruiting
- AC suggests pursuit of revenue displaces public-good mission for market logic
- *Recruiting by universities with similar external conditions can differ depending to what extent "market logic" ideology is adopted*

**"Off-campus recruiting events" defined as off-campus events hosted by paid staff/consultants focused on soliciting applications**

<br>
- Event type
    - Include: college fairs, high school visits, community college visits,
counselor events
    - Exclude: admitted or committed student events, interviews
- Event host
    - Include: paid admissions staff or consultants (e.g. regional recruiters)
    - Exclude: alumni, student volunteers
- Event location
    - Any off-campus location
    - e.g., high school, community college, hotel, convention center, cafe, etc.

# Research methods
## Research design and analyses

Quantitative multiple case study research design `r citep(bib['RN4545'])`
- Quantitative data collection and quantitative analyses
- Analyze each case separately, rather than pooling across cases as in large-N, random sample design

<br>
Data analysis `r citep(bib[c('RN4116','RN4391')])`
- "Within-case" analyses of recruiting patterns
    - Broad focus on income, race, achievement (main independent variables of interest)
    - Situate within local context; "deep dive" of in-state, out-of-state, and overall patterns
        - Simple descriptive statistics (e.g., counts), static visualizations, interactive maps
        - Linear probability models controlling for "rational" reasons for visit (e.g., enrollment size, achievement, distance)
    - Identify first-order empirical themes
- "Cross-case" analyses
    - Consolidate first-order findings into broader empirical themes

# Summary of results
## ¿Suburbios o Barrios? Off-Campus Recruiting by Public Research Universities

Out of State Recruiting
- Majority of visits are out-of-state (exceptions: UC Irvine, UC Berkeley); in populous metros
- Income bias; visits concentrated in highly affluent communities, in metropolitan areas
- Racial bias; less likely to visit schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native students
- Disproportionate number of visits to private high schools

<br>

In-State Recruiting
- Variation in coverage of public high schools (e.g., Nebraska=88%; Alabama=33%)
- Income bias (most cases, but less than out-of-state) even after controlling for other factors
- Bias against schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native in some cases (e.g., Alabama)
- Rural bias; in some cases even after controlling for other factors (e.g., UC Irvine)

<br> 

Recruiting for Resources (RDT) or Recruiting Market Values (AC)
- RDT: Universities with the worst state funding have the most out-of-state visits (Berkeley vs. Irvine)
- AC: Cases with relatively more better environmental conditions do not have a lesser focus on out-of-state (e.g., UMass Amherst, Nebraska)
  
  

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Discussion -->
<!-- ## Implications, future research -->

<!-- Implications -->
<!-- - Results suggest dramatic income bias in enrollment priorities of public research universities -->
<!--     - Evidence of racial bias (especially in out-of-state recruiting), but patterns more nuanced -->
<!-- - Policy discourse should focus on enrollment priorities, rather than student, K-12 deficiencies -->
<!--     - "Under-recruiting" as an alternative explanation for "under-matching" -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Policy + Advocacy Reccomendations: how do we change university enrollment priorities? -->
<!-- - Increasing state appropriations and state need-based grant aid -->
<!-- - Nonresident enrollment caps -->
<!-- - Empower local access advocates  -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Future research -->
<!-- - Manuscript that focuses on spatial discrimination of communities of color -->
<!-- - Collect/analyze data on other means used to identify and target prospects -->
<!--     - Characteristics universities prioritize when purchasing "prospect lists" from College Board/ACT? -->
<!--     - Experimental audits of university responses to "inquiries" with different characteristics -->

# Empirical study #2
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Racial inequality is grounded in the governing of space and its impact on where People of Color live `r citep(bib[c('RN2038', 'RN2547', 'RN5070' )])`
  - Forced migration of indigenous people and seizure of their ancestral lands
  - Plessy v. Ferguson 
  - Policies and court decisions abetted "de facto" segregation after Brown v. Board of Education 
  - Federal and state regulatory tolerance of "reverse redlining" (i.e., predatory lending) 

<br> 

Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6067')])`
  - Communities of Color, particularly low-income communities, are likely to live in areas with limited access to critical resources needed for collective wealth and power 
    - e.g., fair housing, jobs, health facilities

<br> 

Geography of *College* Opportunity `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])`
- *Geography* reinforces access inequality
- Communities of Color have the fewest four-year colleges nearby; many options are for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])`

---
# Motivation
## Do recruiting visits reinforce the geography of unequal college opportunity?
But how does the *behavior* of universities *reinforce* the geography of *unequal* college opportunity?
  - Racial access inequality is grounded in the governing of (admissions) space(s) 
    - e.g, HBCUs, out-of-state tuition and non-resident enrollment caps, SAT/ACT `r cite(bib[c('RN6012', 'RN6011')])`


<br>  

Students' college opportunities are also shaped by the (enrollment management) choices of universities `r citep(bib[c('RN6068')])`
  - Universities are not immobile in their efforts to provide access 
  - Chapter 3 finds schools with greater proportions of Students of Color are less likely to get a visit
    - Schools are not randomly geographically scattered; clustered within segregated Communities of Color
  - Spatial discrimination linked to perpetual racial disparities in the geography of opportunity

<br>

RQ: Do recruiting efforts by public universities spatially discriminate against Communities of Color?
  - Spatial distribution of recruiting visits within the Los Angeles and Dallas MSAs
  - Spatial relationships between race, income, and academic achievement


---
# Literature review
## Geography of College Opportunity

Number of nearby colleges and universities impacts college-going behavior `r citep(bib[c('RN6065')])`
  - Each additional college in proximity to home increases odds of applying to (any) college
  - But proximity to local colleges varied widely

<br>
"College Deserts" and "College Oases" `r citep(bib[c('RN5095')])`
  - Communities of color and communities with low educational attainment 
    - More likely to live in areas with fewer 4-year colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN6064')])`
    - More likely to live in urban areas with more 2-year public and for-profit colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN4446')])`
  - White communities and communities with higher educational attainment
    - More likely to live in suburban areas with more 4-year colleges `r citep(bib[c('RN5095')])`

<br>
Recruiting can circumvent the geography of *unequal* college opportunity; but all literature focuses on analyzing location
  - Universities are not passive actors fixed to their physical campuses
  - Considerable resources are spent on identifying and recruiting prospective students
  - Do recruiting practices circumvent or reinforce the geography of *unequal* college opportunity?

# Enrollment Management
## Neutralized and deracialized practices 
Iron triangle of EM
- EM as neutral, rational, and efficiency maximizing 

<br>

Academic Capitalism
- Universities are not neutral in targeting students for the extraction of revenue
- Race effects within EM practices are due to differential distribution of wealth among racial groups

<br>

Universities and EM practices are not race-neutral `r citep(bib[c('RN2525')])`
- Schemas: unconscious, cognitive assumptions as templates for organizational practices
  - e.g., gender inequality is reproduced via gendered schemas of the "ideal worker" `r citep(bib[c('RN2539')])`
- Racial access inequality is reproduced via racialized schemas of the "ideal college student" 
  - e.g., high SAT/ACT scores, no need for financial aid, enrolls full-time, few obligations besides college classes, lives on campus, ready to begin college-level courses `r citep(bib[c('RN5089')])`

# Conceptual Framework
## Place-based whiteness as property

Space vs. Place `r citep(bib[c('RN5073')])` 
- Space is a physical location where things "just happen" (e.g., a school, a home, a neighborhood)
- Place is the geographical context for the mediation of social and political phenomenon

<br>

Whiteness as property `r citep(bib[c('RN2526')])`
- Law grants holders of whiteness the same privileges granted to holders of other types of property
- Reputation and Status property: legal doctrine that to call someone Black is to defame them

<br>

Place-based whiteness as property
- Racial inequality and white privilege are not simply reflected in space
- Racialized and discriminatory practices are enacted through the use of place

<br>

Recruiting as a raced practice enacted via place
- Lack of status and reputation of "urban schools" in comparison to "suburban schools"
- Are Communities of Color equally as likely to receive a recruiting visit as white communities with comparable income and achievement characteristics?

# Summary of findings
## Sub-Metropolitan Spatial Redlining in Public University Recruitment

Schools within white communities are more likely to receive a recruiting visit than schools within Communities of Color
- Across high, mid, low income levels 
- Exception: mid income communities in LA (although not proportional)

<br>

Racial biases intensify with multiple visits
- Schools within white communities are more likely to receive multiple visits and visits from multiple universities

<br>

Recruiting reinforces the geography of *unequal* college opportunity
- Visits are clustered in predominantly high and mid income White suburbs (i.e., "College Oaeses")
- Spatial redlining of Latinx and Black communities within MSA centers across income levels (i.e., "College Deserts")



---
# Implications
## Policy and practice

Greater consideration of "supply side" scholarship in policy discourse
- Scholarship aimed at changing the behavior of students has dominated policy discourse
- Example: information assymetries
  - Scaled "under-matching" study found null effects
  - Study on financial aid "shopping sheets" found null effects

<br>

Recruiting practices can circumvent geography of unequal college opportunity but...
- Current efforts are based on college going porcess of highly affluent white students 
  - e.g., large college fairs, blocked-out visits, evening events, "coffee chats"
- Administrators and practitoners need to enact practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with low-income students and Students of Color
