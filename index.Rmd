# Motivation 
## Recruiting Students of Color

Recruiting by colleges and universities affect access for Students of Color (SOC) (Holland, 2019)
  - Off-campus recruiting visits influence where SOC apply and enroll
  - Especially first-generation and low-income students


<br> 

Recent research on recruiting visits highlights
  - Public research universities focus their recruiting visits in out-of-state, affluent, predominantly White public high schools (Salazar, Jaquette, & Han, Online First)
  - Public research universities engage in "recruitment redlining" -- circuitous avoidance of public high schools in predominantly Black and Latinx communities along visit paths (Salazar, under review)

<br> 

Where does racial diversity of prospective student pool come from?
  - Private colleges disproportionately enroll Students of Color from elite private schools
  - Do recruiting patterns by public research universities show similar patterns of preferences for prospective Students of Color?
    - Quantitative case-study of recruiting across public and private high schools; by one public research university; within one metropolitan area

# Literature Review
## Intra-Racial Screening Practices 

Organizational and legal scholarship suggests discrimination also occurs intra-racially
  - Colorism; racial palatability (Carbado & Gulati, 2013)


<br>  

Intra-racial screening practices within admissions practices [ethnographies]
  - Black students with high racial salience less likely to receive responses from admissions counselors than those with low racial salience  (Thornhill, 2019)
  - Elite colleges "hedge their bets" in meeting diversity goals by recruiting SOC from elite private schools (Jack, 2019)
  - To increase diversity of applicant pools, recruiters visit "special" public high schools with really "interesting" students (Stevens, 2007)
  

<br>

Do recruiting visits intra-racially screen SOC based on schools targeted? [systematic analyses]
  - Focus on out-of-state, affluent, predominantly White public high schools 
  - "Redline" public high schools in predominantly Black and Latinx communities
  - Gap: probability of receiving a visit across public and private schools through the lens of recruiting SOC

---

# Conceptual Framework
## Racial Capitalism 


Racial Capitalism (Leong, 2013)
- Racism and Capitalism explain how organizations derive social value from non-White identities
- Use of race for determining value longstanding characteristic of systemic racism 
  - White/Whiteness = social and economic value accrue to those that possess it (Harris, 1993)
  - Non-White/non-Whiteness = historically used for withholding value
- Ex: Higher Ed access based on non-Whiteness: HBCUs, non-res policies, holistic admissions

<br>

Non-Whiteness has recently been conferred value based on preoccupation with diversity
  - Ex: Affirmative Action legislation
    - Originally proposed as a form of reparations 
    - Now only justifies increase in diversity efforts because of it's "benefit for all"

<br>

Commodification of non-White identities 
  - Diversity as a social good exploits People of Color to capitalize on their representational diversity
  - Exemplified in growing pressure for colleges to market/recruit/enroll diverse classes
  - EX: Admissions materials that portray greater diversity than student body (Pippert et al., 2013)

---

# Conceptual Framework
## Recruiting "Proximity to Whiteness"

Not all commodities have equal exchange value (Leong, 2013)
- Racial diversity has acquired some value, but limited to "narrow set of scripts" approved by White norms
- Organizations extract the most value from non-White identities that can: (Carbado & Gulati, 2013)
  - Increase representational diversity for the organization
  - Minimize the organizations' need to manage racial salience
  - Easily assimilate into colorblind, predominantly White cultures 

<br>

Recruiting "proximity to whiteness"  via which schools SOC attend
- Literature suggests private colleges want SOC that are already socialized to Whiteness vis-a-vis their high schools
  - Private schools > public high schools (Jack, 2019)
  - Public high schools with predominantly White students > Public high schools with predominantly SOC (Stevens, 2007)
- Do these patterns apply to recruiting by a public research university?

# Methods
## Case selection and data analysis

Case selection based on purposeful sampling to identify "information rich" cases (Patton, 2002)
- Metro areas with sufficient racial and socioeconomic diversity
- Avoid major "school choice" cities (e.g., Denver, New Orleans, New York City)
- Universities with greatest number of recruiting visits to metros selected

<br>

Cases
- Los Angeles MSA
  - University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) 

<br>

Data analysis
- Descriptive statistics and geospatial visualizations

# Summary of findings
## Recruiting Proximity to Whiteness

SOC at private schools more likely to receive a visit than SOC at public high schools
- SOC at visited private schools more likely to attend school with predominantly White peers (relative to private schools that did not receive a visit)
  - vice versa more likely to be one of fewer Black, Latinx, Native American, Asian, and/or Multiracial students at visited private schools
- SOC at visited schools are also more likely to have tuition rates nearly $10,000 more than the average private school

<br>

SOC at public high schools 
- SOC at visited public high schools likely to attend school with predominantly White peers (relative to average public high schools or those that did not receive a visit)

<br>

Suggests that recruiting across public and private high schools in the Los Angeles Metropolitan mimic recruiting by private elite colleges and universities:
- Target SOC from the "same old sources" 
- Reflect intra-racial screening via which high schools SOC attend 




---
# Implications
## Practice and Future Research

Practice: recruiting can circumvent historical college access inequality for Students of Color but...
- "Going where we have always gone" (i.e., predominantly White public and private high schools) intra-racially discriminates against SOC that attend public high schools that enroll predominantly Students of Color 
- Administrators and practitioners need to enact anti-racist practices that are created to mitigate barriers to reaching and connecting with Students of Color from underecruited high schools

<br>

Future Research
- Incorporate comparison of recruiting for one private university
- Expand to other metropolitan areas
