# Motivation
## Policy discourse about access to public research universities

The problem: access to public research universities
- Historical mission of social mobility for meritorious state residents
- Concern about growing socioeconomic and racial inequality in access

<br>
Mainstream policy discourse about access inequality
- "Achievement gap", "under-matching"; place responsibility on students, K-12 schools
- Universities pledge commitment to access via policies (e.g., holistic admission)
- Problem with policy discourse: decades of research finds policy adoption a symbolic effort to appease stakeholders `r cite(bib['RN2436'])`

<br>
Geography of Opportunity `r citep(bib['RN6067'])`
- Educational opportunities are a function of where students live 
- Number of local colleges and universities spatially varies along the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods `r citep(bib['RN6064'])`
- Shifts onus away from students and K-12 schools; but students' college choices are also shaped by choices of colleges and universities `r citep(bib['RN6068'])`


---

# Motivation
## Analyze recruiting to understand university enrollment priorities

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or communities of color

<br>
Why study university recruiting behavior
- Universities expend substantial resources identifying and recruiting prospects `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
- Internal resource allocation better indicator of organizational priorities than rhetoric, policies
- Knowing which student populations targeted by recruiting efforts indicates enrollment priorities


<br>
Research focus
- Analyze off-campus recruiting visits (e.g., visit to a local high school) by public research universities as a means of gaining insight about university enrollment priorities
- **Research question**
    - What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across universities?
- **Analytic focus**
    - Income; race; academic achievement; in-state vs. out-of-state


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*  `r citep(bib['RN4017'])`
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")
- Applauds public universities for adopting progressive policies to increase access despite the “deficiencies” of student and K-12 schools and despite declines in state funding. 
```

# Background
## The enrollment management industry

*** =left

**The enrollment funnel**

<img src="assets/img/New-Admissions-Funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - Buy "student lists" from College Board/ACT
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus recruiting visits** (e.g., high
school visits, college fairs)
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * Financial aid leveraging


---

# Literature review
## Scholarship on recruiting

Evaluations of recruiting/outreach interventions `r cite(bib[c('RN4408')])`
- But unclear whether universities substantively adopt "best practices" in less controlled settings

Audits of response to "inquiries" by admissions officers `r cite(bib[c('RN4331','RN4360')])`
- Identifies biases of individual admissions officers

<br>
Off-campus recruiting visits
- Scholarship analyzing college perspective `r citep(bib['RN3519'])`
    - Important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
- Market research `r citep(bib['RN4402'])`
    - Second highest source of "inquiries"; third highest source of enrollees 
- Scholarship analyzing perspective of high school students `r citep(bib['RN4324'])`
    - Which universities visit affects student decisions; especially first-gen, students of color

<br>
Research gap: we don't know which universities visit which schools, communities
- If schools in low-income communities or communities of color are not receiving visits, "under-matching" may be due to under-recruiting rather than lack of guidance

---

# Theoretical framework
## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior

Theoretical motivation for studying recruiting
<br>
- "New" institutional theory `r citep(bib['RN513'])`
    - Organizations have finite resources and cannot pursue multiple goals `r citep(bib['RN531'])`
    -When facing pressure to pursue many goals, organizations: 
      - Substantively adopt some goals (directing resources)
      - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric)

<br>
- "Iron triangle" of enrollment management (EM)
  - Three broad enrollment goals: **access, academic profile, revenue**
  - Scarce resources; depending on priorities, some goals receive more resources than others
  - Off-campus recruiting is allocation of resources
  - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting interventions indicate enrollment priorities



---

# Theoretical framework
## Expectations about similarities and differences in recruiting behavior

Resource dependence theory (RDT) `r citep(bib['RN959'])`
- Sensitive to demands from providers of important resources that cannot be obtained elsewhere
- Org strategies when a resouce becomes uncertain/declines or demands become onerous
    - e.g., compliance, avoidance, cooptation, **resource diversification**
- *Universities with weak state funding*
    - More visits to affluent out-of-state, affluent in-state
- *Universities with small/declining "college age" population*
    - More out-of-state visits

<br>
Academic Capitalism (AC) `r citep(bib['RN6061'])` 
- RDT assumes restoring state funding would compel universities to de-emphasize nonresident enrollment/recruiting
- AC suggests pursuit of revenue displaces public-good mission for market logic
- *Recruiting by universities with similar external conditions can differ depending how whether or to what extent "market logic" ideology is adopted*

# Research methods
## The broader off-campus recruiting research project

*** =left

**Data collection**

* Method
    - Web-scrape admissions websites
    - Public records requests
* Criteria to be included in data collection
    1. Post visits on admissions websites
    2. Organizational type
* Data collection sample (larger project)
    - 54 public research universities
    - 49 private research universities
    - 42 selective private liberal arts
* Data collection period
    - 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017
    - Ongoing data collection with larger sample

# Research methods
## Defining events

**"Off-campus recruiting events" defined as off-campus events hosted by paid staff/consultants focused on soliciting applications**

<br>
- Event type
    - Include: college fairs, high school visits, community college visits,
counselor events
    - Exclude: admitted or committed student events, interviews
- Event host
    - Include: paid admissions staff or consultants (e.g. regional recruiters)
    - Exclude: alumni, student volunteers
- Event location
    - Any off-campus location
    - e.g., high school, community college, hotel, convention center, cafe, etc.

# Research methods
## Research design and analyses

Quantitative multiple case study research design `r citep(bib['RN4545'])`
- Quantitative data collection and quantitative analyses
- Analyze each case separately, rather than pooling across cases as in large-N, random sample design

<br>
Data analysis `r citep(bib[c('RN4116','RN4391')])`
- "Within-case" analyses of recruiting patterns
    - Broad focus on income, race, achievement (main independent variables of interest)
    - Situate within local context; "deep dive" of in-state, out-of-state, and overall patterns
        - Simple descriptive statistics (e.g., counts), static visualizations, interactive maps
        - Linear probability models controlling for "rational" reasons for visit (e.g., enrollment size, achievement, distance)
    - Identify first-order empirical themes
- "Cross-case" analyses
    - Consolidate first-order findings into broader empirical themes

# Summary
## Summary of results

Out of State Recruiting
- Majority of visits are out-of-state (exceptions: UC Irvine, UC Berkeley); in populous metros
- Income bias; visits concentrated in highly affluent communities, in metropolitan areas
- Racial bias; less likely to visit schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native students
- Disproportionate number of visits to private high schools

In-State Recruiting
- Variation in coverage of public high schools (e.g., Nebraska=88%; Alabama=33%)
- Income bias (most cases, but less than out-of-state) even after controlling for "rational" reasons
- Bias against schools with predominantly Black/Hispanic/Native in some cases (e.g., Alabama)
- Rural bias; in some cases even after controlling for other factors (e.g. UC Irvine)

Recruiting for Resources (RDT) or Recruiting Market Values (AC)
- RDT: focus on out-of-state recruiting is linked to declines in state funding
  - Universities with the worst state funding have the most out-of-state visits (Berkeley vs. Irvine)
- AC: out-of-state recruiting focus and biases are only partly a function of unfavorable environment
  - Cases with relatively more better environmental conditions do not have a lesser focus on out-of-state (e.g., UMass Amherst, Nebraska)

# Discussion
## Implications, future research

Implications
- Results suggest dramatic income bias in enrollment priorities of public research universities
    - Evidence of racial bias (especially in out-of-state recruiting), but patterns more nuanced
- Policy discourse should focus on enrollment priorities, rather than student, K-12 deficiencies
    - "Under-recruiting" as an alternative explanation for "under-matching"
    
<br>
Policy + Advocacy Reccomendations: how do we change university enrollment priorities?
- Increasing state appropriations and state need-based grant aid
- Nonresident enrollment caps
- Empower local access advocates 

<br>
Future research
- Manuscript that focuses on spatial discrimination of communities of color
- Collect/analyze data on other means used to identify and target prospects
    - Characteristics universities prioritize when purchasing "prospect lists" from College Board/ACT?
    - Experimental audits of university responses to "inquiries" with different characteristics
